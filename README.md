This project demonstrates how to containerize and orchestrate a full-stack web application using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.  
The application consists of:
- **Front-end**: Static website served via **Nginx**.
- **Back-end**: API server built with **Flask** (Python) and **Flask-CORS**.
- **Proxy server**: Nginx reverse proxy that routes requests to the appropriate service.
- **Load balancing**: Nginx load balancer distributing traffic between multiple API servers.
